Feature: Edge AI Model Inference
  As a developer
  I want to test Edge AI model inference capabilities
  So that I can ensure reliable performance and accuracy

  Background:
    Given the Edge AI engine is initialized
    And the system is running

  Scenario: Successful model inference
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And the model is ready for inference
    When I run inference on the model
    Then the inference should complete successfully
    And the result should be valid
    And the inference should complete within 100 milliseconds

  Scenario: Model inference with custom input
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And I have custom input data
    When I run inference with the custom input
    Then the inference should complete successfully
    And the output should match expected results
    And the inference should complete within 200 milliseconds

  Scenario: Batch inference processing
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And I have a batch of input data
    When I run batch inference
    Then all inferences should complete successfully
    And the batch processing should be efficient
    And the total time should be less than individual inference times

  Scenario: Model inference with performance constraints
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And performance constraints are set
    When I run inference under constraints
    Then the inference should respect memory limits
    And the inference should respect CPU limits
    And the inference should complete within performance bounds

  Scenario Outline: Model inference with different input sizes
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And I have input data of size <input_size>
    When I run inference on the input
    Then the inference should complete successfully
    And the processing time should be proportional to input size
    And the memory usage should be within limits

    Examples:
      | input_size |
      | 1x1x3      |
      | 224x224x3  |
      | 512x512x3  |
      | 1024x1024x3|

  Scenario: Model inference error handling
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And I have invalid input data
    When I run inference on the invalid input
    Then the system should handle the error gracefully
    And an appropriate error message should be returned
    And the system should remain stable

  Scenario: Concurrent model inference
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And multiple inference requests are queued
    When I run concurrent inference requests
    Then all inferences should complete successfully
    And the system should handle concurrency properly
    And no race conditions should occur

  Scenario: Model inference with hardware acceleration
    Given an Edge AI model is loaded
    And hardware acceleration is available
    When I run inference with hardware acceleration
    Then the inference should use hardware acceleration
    And the performance should be improved
    And the inference should complete within accelerated time limits

  Scenario: Model inference with quantization
    Given a quantized Edge AI model is loaded
    And the model uses quantization
    When I run inference on the quantized model
    Then the inference should complete successfully
    And the accuracy should be within acceptable limits
    And the model size should be reduced

  Scenario: Model inference with pruning
    Given a pruned Edge AI model is loaded
    And the model uses pruning
    When I run inference on the pruned model
    Then the inference should complete successfully
    And the accuracy should be maintained
    And the inference speed should be improved
